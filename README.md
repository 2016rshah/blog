#Start your own BlaTeX blog with this theme

 - Install [BlaTeX](https://github.com/2016rshah/BlaTeX)
 - Fork and clone this repo (not the BlaTeX repo, this one!)
 - Edit the `index.html.bltx` file with your own info (name, picture, tagline, etc.)
 - Clear the posts directory and write your own posts
 - `blatex build`
 - Push to github
 - ???
 - Win.
