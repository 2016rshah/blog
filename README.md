#My thoughts
Mostly in the form of beautiful LaTeX generated, Heckle compiled PDFs.

#Start your own Heckle blog with this theme

 - Install [Heckle](https://github.com/2016rshah/heckle)
 - Fork and clone this repo (not the Heckle repo, this one!)
 - Edit the `index.html.hkl` file with your own info (name, picture, tagline, etc.)
 - Edit the `template.html.hkl` file with your own info (like above)
 - Clear the posts directory and write your own posts
 - `heckle build`
 - Push to github
 - ???
 - Win.
