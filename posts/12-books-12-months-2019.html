<h3 id="things-ive-been-silent-about-by-azar-nafisi-january"><em>Things I've Been Silent About</em> by Azar Nafisi (January)</h3>
<p>This book can best be described as a family memoir. It covered the author's life, the life of her father, and the life of her mother against the backdrop of Tehran, Iran.</p>
<p>The book paints a nuanced picture of Tehran and Iranian politics in the mid to late 1900s. I could feel Nafisi's patriotism through her writing: when her country faltered, her heart broke, but she didn't let that diminish her criticism.</p>
<p>An individual's viewpoint of history-altering events is so interesting. It is at once myopic and self-centered, and yet also provides a much fuller picture than a Wikipedia page or news report can. Personal perspective can't provide insight about aggregated statistics (like how many people died, etc.) but can answer questions like what events stood out to every day Iranians who attended Azar's mother's coffee chats? For example, Azar talks extensively about her mother's voting record on legislation like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhollah_Khomeini#Opposition_to_capitulation">Capitulation Law</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%27s_Family_Protection_Law">Family Protection Act</a>, and yet those pieces of legislation aren't even mentioned in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution">Wikipedia page on the Iranian Revolution</a>. I wonder what I will remember about this time in our history.</p>
<p>The book also gave me a window into another family's internal politics. I listened to the audiobook during the one month I spend with my parents each year. Nafisi's characterization of her high-achieving family resonated with my perspective of my own family: sometimes it is hard to separate the tension and the love. How sustainable is it to confine such a density of passion to one roof?</p>
