<p>Back in August 2017 I published the following post on my blog and facebook: <a href="https://www.rshah.org/blog/posts/charity_match_2017.html">TLDR: I'll match your donations to charity</a>. The idea was simple: I wanted to donate money I earned at my internship to charity and I wanted my peers to do something similar.</p>
<p>Overall, we raised around $2,279 for <em><a href="http://www.sheshouldrun.org/">She Should Run</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Where-to-Donate/Fistula-Foundation">The Fistula Foundation</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.rainn.org/">The Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN)</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://nwlc.org/issues/">The National Women's Law Center</a></em>. $2.2k might not sound like a lot compared to the amount these charities raise every year. But, I'm a 19 year old sophomore in college, so to me $2.2k sounds like &quot;HELL YEAH ðŸš€&quot;!</p>
<p>&quot;Grassroots&quot; doesn't even begin to describe this effort.</p>
<pre><code> - The average donation was about $50
 - 13 out of the 17 donors may not legally consume alcohol in the US 
 - Out of my ~1,000 facebook friends
	- ~10% of them liked the post
	- ~1% of them shared my post to their own timelines
 - At least three of my friends pledged to similarly match their friend's donations</code></pre>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>A ton of people came together to make this happen:</p>
<p>Firstly, and I can't emphasize this enough, I want to thank the 17 people who donated.</p>
<p>Madalyn Marebella was the moral compass, north star, and ultimate partner-in-crime for this whole project. Logistics wise, she eloquently pitched the Fistula Foundation, dug up high-quality research about charities and their efficacy that I could not have found in a million years, provided a cogent voice for the messaging of the project, and really helped craft the vision. Personally, she also helped me formulate what I wanted to do into a real plan, provided a friendly ear for my ramblings, and kept me honest in following through with the pipe dream.</p>
<p>I am in no way financially independent, so, obviously, I call my parents about any large financial commitments. I want to thank them first for the shocked silence when I pitched the idea to them, and thank them second for their incredible support in encouraging me to pursue this opportunity.</p>
<p>This was pretty much all I could think of towards the end of the summer, so I also need to make a blanket &quot;thank you&quot; to everybody who humored me in brainstorming with them when we had a conversation.</p>
<p>And finally, I want to pre-emptively thank everyone who participates in future internship charity matches like this. This isn't over!</p>
<h3 id="onwards-and-upwards">Onwards and Upwards</h3>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised with how this year went, to say the least. In one of our many conversations about best/worst case scenarios, I told Madalyn that I would consider the entire thing a success if we even managed to raise $100 of outside money. I told myself if we met that modest goal, I would do a similar project after all my future summer internships. Here we are a few months later, more than $2,000 over the goal, and I am beyond pumped to keep my word.</p>
<p>I was nervous about this experiment, and I am so proud of how far it came. I have big plans for my charity match in 2018. I'll point to this project's success when I try to get more of my friends to commit to similar donation matching projects for their internship money. Even after me and my youthful naÃ¯vetÃ© and optimism are long gone, I want this trend of donating a fraction of your internship salary to carry on. I'm hoping eventually it's just a normal thing that a lot of people do every year. Say what you will about &quot;kids these days&quot;, but I have high hopes that we want to (and will!) help the world around us.</p></div>
