### *The Importance of Being Earnest* by Oscar Wilde (January)

> "If I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by being always immensely over-educated" <br> Algernon (Act II, Page 25)

What a way to start off the year, this play was so good! I was tickled pink by how the dialogue and scenarios were perfectly absurd.

This play was perfect for me because I was looking for something lighthearted, I really enjoyed reading Wilde's *A Picture of Dorian Gray* back in the day, and I get public domain books like this for free on my Amazon Kindle. Needless to say, I was not disappointed at all. Because I enjoyed both of Oscar Wilde's pieces so much, I read up a bit on him and his literature. This led me to learn about the role of a "dandy" in Wilde's work. From [this Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/sep/18/theimportanceofbeingdandy) we can learn that "A dandy is, of course, a man overwhelmingly preoccupied with appearance and whose life is presented as a work of art". I love it. The dandy aesthetic is something I can absolutely get on board with. 

### *On Civil Disobedience* by Henry David Thoreau (January Bonus Round!)

I had high hopes for this book. I remember how highly my AP US History teacher in high school spoke about transcendentalism and how she lamented that she didn't have more time to go over the work of Henry David Thoreau and his contemporaries. This was another book I found for free on my Amazon Kindle because it is public domain, so I decided to give it a shot. 

Unfortunately I was less than impressed. I knew I wasn't going to be on board with everything Thoreau said when the first words in the extended essay were:

> I heartily accept the motto, "That government is best which governs least"; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe -- "That government is best which governs not at all"; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.  

Thoreau goes on to make the following argument: If the government is doing something wrong, you should disagree with the government. If you disagree with the government you should do *everything* in your power to stop the government from doing wrong (not just vote, but truly everything in your power).

Even after reading this extended essay I still haven't made up my mind about where I stand on civil disobedience as a concept. On one hand, I recognize that de jure solutions to unjust laws are doomed to be inneffectual, I admire John Lewis's practice of #GoodTrouble, and (in extreme cases like the abolition of slavery) I see the value in revoking the consent of the governed. On the other hand I tend to think of the government as more good than it is bad, I do not think that opposing certain facets of the government warrants opposing the government entirely, and I am far more confident in traditional methods of civic engagement (voting, etc.) than Thoreau is.  

<!-- I really like the idea of taxes, and I am more receptive to "adopting the ways the State has provided for remedying the evil" than -->

I think it is important to note the privilege from which I am speaking. Slavery has been abolished, and I cannot think of a similarly divisive issue that threatens to plunge the US into a civil war. Similarly, the military conflicts we are presently engaged in are far further out of sight and mind than the Mexican American War was for Thoreau. I think I'm pretty dovish, but in my short life I've never been directly faced with the realities of international military conflict; I can't definitively say one way or the other how hawkish I really am. Thus, the policy questions I am weighing today feel less all-or-nothing than those of Thoreau's era. 

But I also think it is important to note the privilege from which Thoreau is speaking: "For my own part, I should not like to think that I ever rely on the protection of the State". The role and scope of government has changed since this article was written in 1849 -- now there are people who, due to circumstances out of their control, do rely on the protection of the State. They do not have the flexibility to accept the motto "that government is best which governs least". Thoreau did not consider this population in his essay because he was before their time, but that does not mean modern discussion can similarly disregard this group. 

In general, I think I agree with most of the specific things Henry David Thoreau said about the problems of his time and his responses. However, I hesitate to generalize them past his specific scenario and I would be skeptical of arguments for modern issues that build on his words. 

### *A River Runs Through It & Other Stories* by Norman Maclean (January Bonus Rounds!)

<!-- Recommended to me by Connor Chewning; Avni Nandu said it was like a great book she really liked. -->

These stories are about Montana, and fly fishing, and having a preacher for a father, and whores, and the US Forest Service. As a affluent Indian kid attending college in the middle of a big city, I can relate to approximately none of those subjects. Obviously there is value to reading stories outside of your sphere of knowledge and yadda yadda. But I still almost quit after the first short story, not wanting to read the other two. 

These books reminded me of my childhood in the Appalachian mountains on the border of Ohio and West Virginia. Here's a weird memory from middle school: every year we would all be required to submit to an essay contest where the only prompt was "I am a child of Appalachia". It was interesting to write because I didn't identify as a child of Appalachia, but I did identify as the kind of child who would win essay contests [^footnote1]. 

We were also required to read a remarkable amount of what I can best classify as "wilderness literature" (*The Red Pony*, *Hatchet*, *Tom Sawyer*, *Where the Red Fern Grows*, etc.). Again, I never really felt like I could relate, but in retrospect some elements of my childhood were pretty rugged. I dirt-biked on weekends because that was the normal activity to spend a Saturday morning doing. There was a hill next to my house that my friends and I would bike to and then climb -- once we were there we would pick the burrs off our clothes, skip rocks in the pond for hours, and forage through the honeysuckle vines. All the license plates in the area had the phrase "WV: Wild and Wonderful" on them, and I think that's surprisingly accurate. 

Because of reading *Where the Red Fern Grows* I know more about 'coon hunting than you would expect someone in my demographic to know. Similarly, now that I've read this book I guess I know a surprising amount about fly fishing for the fact that I have never (and will never) go fishing. But also just like *Where the Red Fern Grows*, this book wasn't just about killing animals. It was about a boy growing up in the presence of nature. And I like to think that is something I can identify with. 


[^footnote1]: I never did win, but I remember one of my three best friends won our school's contest and went on to win the whole regional contest or something.
