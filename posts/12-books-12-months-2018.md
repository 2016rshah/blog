### *The Importance of Being Earnest* by Oscar Wilde (January)

> "If I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by being always immensely over-educated" <br> Algernon (Act II, Page 25)

What a way to start off the year, this play was so good! I was tickled pink by how the dialogue and scenarios were perfectly absurd.

This play was perfect for me because I was looking for something lighthearted, I really enjoyed reading Wilde's *A Picture of Dorian Gray* back in the day, and I get public domain books like this for free on my Amazon Kindle. Needless to say, I was not disappointed at all. Because I enjoyed both of Oscar Wilde's pieces so much, I read up a bit on him and his literature. This led me to learn about the role of a "dandy" in Wilde's work. From [this Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/sep/18/theimportanceofbeingdandy) we can learn that "A dandy is, of course, a man overwhelmingly preoccupied with appearance and whose life is presented as a work of art". I love it. The dandy aesthetic is something I can absolutely get on board with. 

### *On Civil Disobedience* by Henry David Thoreau (January Bonus Round!)

I had high hopes for this book. I remember how highly my AP US History teacher in high school spoke about transcendentalism and how she lamented that she didn't have more time to go over the work of Henry David Thoreau and his contemporaries. This was another book I found for free on my Amazon Kindle because it is public domain, so I decided to give it a shot. 

Unfortunately I was less than impressed. I knew I wasn't going to be on board with everything Thoreau said when the first words in the extended essay were:

> I heartily accept the motto, "That government is best which governs least"; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe -- "That government is best which governs not at all"; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.  

Thoreau goes on to make the following argument: If the government is doing something wrong, you should disagree with the government. If you disagree with the government you should do *everything* in your power to stop the government from doing wrong (not just vote, but truly everything in your power).

Even after reading this extended essay I still haven't made up my mind about where I stand on civil disobedience as a concept. On one hand, I recognize that de jure solutions to unjust laws are doomed to be inneffectual, I admire John Lewis's practice of #GoodTrouble, and (in extreme cases like the abolition of slavery) I see the value in revoking the consent of the governed. On the other hand I tend to think of the government as more good than it is bad, I do not think that opposing certain facets of the government warrants opposing the government entirely, and I am far more confident in traditional methods of civic engagement (voting, etc.) than Thoreau is.  

<!-- I really like the idea of taxes, and I am more receptive to "adopting the ways the State has provided for remedying the evil" than -->

I think it is important to note the privilege from which I am speaking. Slavery has been abolished, and I cannot think of a similarly divisive issue that threatens to plunge the US into a civil war. Similarly, the military conflicts we are presently engaged in are far further out of sight and mind than the Mexican American War was for Thoreau. I think I'm pretty dovish, but in my short life I've never been directly faced with the realities of international military conflict; I can't definitively say one way or the other how hawkish I really am. Thus, the policy questions I am weighing today feel less all-or-nothing than those of Thoreau's era. 

But I also think it is important to note the privilege from which Thoreau is speaking: "For my own part, I should not like to think that I ever rely on the protection of the State". The role and scope of government has changed since this article was written in 1849 -- now there are people who, due to circumstances out of their control, do rely on the protection of the State. They do not have the flexibility to accept the motto "that government is best which governs least". Thoreau did not consider this population in his essay because he was before their time, but that does not mean modern discussion can similarly disregard this group. 

In general, I think I agree with most of the specific things Henry David Thoreau said about the problems of his time and his responses. However, I hesitate to generalize them past his specific scenario and I would be skeptical of arguments for modern issues that build on his words. 

### *A River Runs Through It & Other Stories* by Norman Maclean (January Bonus Rounds!)

<!-- Recommended to me by Connor Chewning; Avni Nandu said it was like a great book she really liked. -->

These stories are about Montana, and fly fishing, and having a preacher for a father, and whores, and the US Forest Service. As a affluent Indian kid attending college in the middle of a big city, I can relate to approximately none of those subjects. Obviously there is value to reading stories outside of your sphere of knowledge and yadda yadda. But I still almost quit after the first short story, not wanting to read the other two. 

These books reminded me of my childhood in the Appalachian mountains on the border of Ohio and West Virginia. Here's a weird memory from middle school: every year we would all be required to submit to an essay contest where the only prompt was "I am a child of Appalachia". It was interesting to write because I didn't identify as a child of Appalachia, but I did identify as the kind of child who would win essay contests [^footnote1]. 

We were also required to read a remarkable amount of what I can best classify as "wilderness literature" (*The Red Pony*, *Hatchet*, *Tom Sawyer*, *Where the Red Fern Grows*, etc.). Again, I never really felt like I could relate, but in retrospect some elements of my childhood were pretty rugged. I dirt-biked on weekends because that was the normal activity to spend a Saturday morning doing. There was a hill next to my house that my friends and I would bike to and then climb -- once we were there we would pick the burrs off our clothes, skip rocks in the pond for hours, and forage through the honeysuckle vines. All the license plates in the area had the phrase "WV: Wild and Wonderful" on them, and I think that's surprisingly accurate. 

Because of reading *Where the Red Fern Grows* I know more about 'coon hunting than you would expect someone in my demographic to know. Similarly, now that I've read this book I guess I know a surprising amount about fly fishing for the fact that I have never (and will never) go fishing. But also just like *Where the Red Fern Grows*, this book wasn't just about killing animals. It was about a boy growing up in the presence of nature. And I like to think that is something I can identify with. 


### *The New Jim Crow* by Michelle Alexander (February)

> "The unfortunate reality we must face is that racism manifests itself not only in individual attitudes and stereotypes, but also in the basic structure of society" <br> (Page 184)

On a surface level, I knew America had obviously not vanquished the racism that has perennialy plagued us. But until I read this book I did not truly appreciate the magnitude to which racism permeates the very fabric of society today. The book outlined the ways in which our current criminal justice system is inexcusably structured to oppress communities of color, and demonstrated the broader impact this has on every aspect of life in America. 

I only had a hazy understanding of the following concepts before this book, but now I can clearly articulate what each one is really about: 

 - Mandatory minimum drug sentences  
 <!-- I had heard the tag-line "mandatory minimums are racist" from the West Wing. I agreed that the statistics presented seemed pretty damning. I was able to register that fact in my brain, ignore it, and continue with my day-to-day life. But then this book really drove the point home. Here's a quick rundown. Crack cocaine and powder cocaine are chemically the same drug. The difference is how they are ingested (injected versus snorted, respectively). Because they are (chemically speaking) the same drug, they have the same effect on the body. Traditionally, crack cocaine was primarily used by communities of color and powder cocaine was primarily used by caucasians. It takes 100 times the amount of  -->
 - For-profit prisons  
 - The unfairness of plea "bargains"  
 - Disenfranchisement of communities of color  
 - The War on Drugs  

I tried to tie each of these concepts together into a quick overview for people unfamiliar (or only vaguely familiar) with the topic. I stopped because I kept remembering connected concepts that I would also need to add for context. Pretty quickly I realized that I would need an entire book to survey everything wrong with the current situation, and that whole book was sitting on the table right in front of me. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Read this book. Trust me. 

As I read the book I was mainly just angry. Not sad or disappointed, but angry and frustrated. The most frustrating part was that the system is *not* unfair to me, or even to anyone I know for that matter. If I hadn't read this book, I would be able to live my whole life living in blissful ignorance of how dire the situation is. I feel tricked. 

I am a part of a non-partisan civic engagement organization called TX Votes, which basically just registers people to vote and distributes non-partisan voting information in my area. *The New Jim Crow* has convinced me that TX Votes should concentrate some amount of effort to registering ex-felons to vote. For context, felons lose the right to vote in Texas, and only regain it after they have completed their sentence. There is a process to get re-registered (filling out a form), and I'm guessing no one reminds them to do so, which leads me to believe the voter registration rates for ex-felons is pretty low. This low rate is a tool of voter disenfranchisement, which hopefully I can help combat with this new project idea. Everything is still very much in the planning/research stage, but I've taken a few steps to get the ball rolling and hopefully we can get the plan implemented. It would be really valuable, so I really hope I follow through with this idea. 

<!-- Reading this book made me angry that the system is so unfair. What made me particularly angry was that the system is *not* unfair to me, or even to anyone I know for that matter. -->

<!-- things I needed to add  -->

<!-- racism this book exposes is not just the obvious actions of racist people, but rather the type of racism that permeates every aspect of many people's lives. -->

<!-- I don't just understand sexism, I *understand* sexism. I understand how sexism permeates every aspect of many people's lives and is not just reflected in the actions of explicitly misogynistic people.

### *Between the World and Me* by Ta-Nehisi Coates (March)

<img style="max-width:25%; float:right; margin:3px;" src='../resources/12-books-12-months-2018/between-the-world-and-me.jpg' />

> "[...] exulting non-violence for the weak and the biggest guns for the strong" <br> (Page 131)

The last book I read was *The New Jim Crow*, which gave me mountains of cold, hard facts and evidence about the effect of racism in America today on a macroscopic scale. *Between the World and Me* was a short memoir that helped me form a more complete image by providing insight on a personal scale from someone's lived experience.

I really enjoyed reading the book, and was very impressed with the writing. Coates structured the book as a letter to his son about his life as a black man in America. It was a good supplement to *The New Jim Crow* so I'm really glad I read them back-to-back. 

Once again, I'm having trouble summarizing what I liked about the book without just rewriting the whole book on this page. I really did think it was a good book, though, and it was pretty small so it is definitely worth the read if you're interested in memoir style books or race relations. 

### *The Kite Runner* by Khaled Hosseini (March Bonus Round!)

<img style="max-width:25%; float:right; margin:3px;" src='../resources/12-books-12-months-2018/kite-runner.jpg' />

> "You probably lived in a big two- or three-story house with a nice back yard that your gardener filled with flowers and fruit trees. All gated, of course. Your father drove an American car. You had servants, probably Hazaras. Your parents hired workers to decorate the house for the fancy *mehmanis* they threw, so their friends would come over to drink and boast about their travels to Europe or America." [...] He pointed to an old man dressed in ragged clothes trudging down a dirt path, a large burlap pack filled with scrub grass tied to his back. "That's the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That's the Afghanistan I know. You? You've always been a tourist here, you just didn't know it." <br> (Chapter 19)

I'm glad I read this book because I think it was an important part of pop-culture that I no longer feel excluded from. FOMO [^footnote2] is an interesting motive for reading: is it a good utilization of the cultural phenomenon of FOMO or is it a bastardization of reading as a tool for fulfillment? 

I did not enjoy reading this book. Maybe this isn't the type of book you're supposed to enjoy reading. But speaking more broadly, I don't really like fiction books. Terrible things happened to the characters of this book, and in turn they did terrible things. Stories like this are meant to reflect life's unfortunate realitites, and the characters are just a vessel for the story. But I had trouble finding empathy for the scenarios because it was easy for me to dismiss them as contrived. 

<!-- World-building is not interesting to me, even though it is supposed to be the most intriguing part of sci-fi books. In the same way, I have trouble investing myself in the characters of this book because I know they don't exist.  -->

<!-- This book is supposed to be powerful. Moving, even. And sure, it was cool to read. But there were times when I would read about actions the main character would take and it would just make me feel sick. Stories are meant to teach you something about life, but I felt like when I was reading this book I was just reading the story to entertain rather than to learn. And I wasn't even being entertained, so like what's the point?  -->
