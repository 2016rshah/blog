<p>Professor Aaronson,</p>
<p>My name is Rushi. I grew up as an second-gen Indian kid in a very white and rural part of Appalachia for elementary and middle school. But then, I moved to northern Virginia at the end of middle school, and graduated from TJHSST in 2016. I went on to graduate from UTCS as a Turing Scholar in 2020. Although I didn't hear your talk at TJ in 2015, I've heard you speak at UTCS often. I've also been a sympathetic reader of some of your blog posts, including <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2620">this one</a>. This has led me to feel well positioned to rebut <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4979">your most recent blog post</a> about TJ's decision to implement a merit lottery admissions system.</p>
<p>Here is an outline of my main argument:</p>
<p>&quot;What is an equitable way to allocate scarce resources to undifferentiated consumers? In particular, what is an equitable way to allocate access to the best public high school to impressionable 14 year olds who are early enough in the pipeline to close any real or percieved &quot;merit&quot; gaps they may have?&quot;</p>
<p>My opinion is that there will always be nondeterminism in that allocation process. I believe it is a myth that the current admissions systems biases the nondeterminism towards 14 year olds with &quot;merit&quot;, partially because I don't believe there is any existing metric of merit that can reasonably be applied to 14 year olds. I also note that the holistic review instead biases towards students with high socioeconomic status and students geographically within the high caste segregated neighbourhoods (Kilmer Middle School, etc.), neither of which should qualify as &quot;merit&quot;.</p>
<p>I prefer making the nondeterminism explicit with a lottery, rather than hiding it behind a holistic review.</p>
<p>I close by addressing some specific quotes from your blog post directly, and raising some issues I felt you did not sufficiently address.</p>
<p>There are many claims and implicit assumptions made in the argument I just outlined, which I will spend the rest of this note justifying. I hope you come away from the reading with the conclusion that a lottery is a justifiable and reasonable solution to the intractable problem of scarce resource allocation.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>To begin, I will start by saying that more schools like TJ is a great idea. Until we address that scarcity, though, we need to allocate resources (seats at TJ) to 14 year olds.</p>
<p>Let me first claim that there is no metric of merit that can be reasonably applied to 14 year olds. I want to emphasize that the students being selected to attend TJ are eight graders at the end of middle school. A 14 year old may seem special in the eyes of their parents, but they realistically haven't had time to become &quot;successful&quot; yet. Even if one 14 year old solves P=NP, the rest of the 479 students went to the same soccer practice as everyone else. Instead, you may argue, the admissions committee is <em>predicting</em> which students will become successful. But as I'm learning in my <a href="https://msalganik.github.io/cos597E-soc555_f2020/">Limits of Prediction class</a> at Princeton, the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/15/8234">Fragile Families Challenge</a> suggests that such predictions are inevitably going to be snake oil.</p>
<p>Even if there is some magic metric, any merit gaps that exist at 14 will be smoothed over by a robust educational environment, like that of a student's 9th grade year at TJ. The first year of TJ is challenging, and the students all have to learn how to adjust to an incredible amount of coursework. TJ will improve your work ethic, improve your time management skills, and provide you the knowledge you desire. After all, schools are meant to teach you things, not just rest on the laurels of prerequisites. I would even venture to make a stronger claim: the only prerequisite for succeeding at TJ is a strong desire to learn.</p>
<p>Furthermore, public education has an obligation to play a role in addressing these merit gaps. As a public school, TJ has the opportunity and responsibility to stop the cycle of perpetuated social and economic inequality. Concretely, TJ provides a &quot;Foundations of Computer Science&quot; class offered freshman year that expects no prerequisites. I took it coming straight out of a rural Appalachian school, and can confirm it starts from the very beginning. In contrast, our very own Turing program only accepts you if you have prior experience in Computer Science (which is unfortunate, in my opinion). So Turing blames TJ and other high schools for the pipeline problem of minorities into CS, and now high schools are trying to turn around and blame middle schools for the pipeline problem. But the buck has to stop somewhere, and I am skeptical that the end of middle school is too late. That kind of defeatism is disingenous at worst, and lazy at best. TJ smoothed out my merit gap, and has a responsibility as a public school to continue to do so.</p>
<p>These three claims clarify that the consumers (14 year olds) should be, and in fact are, indistinguishable from the perspective of merit. Nevertheless, admissions must be capped, so the admissions committee is tasked with distinguishing the students. In practice, rather than selecting based on the basis of mythical merit, the admissions committee solves the much easier problem of selecting based on socioeconomic status and geographic location (which is functionally a proxy variable for race).</p>
<p>Admissions largely selects students with high socioeconomic status and students from the high caste segregated communities, like Kilmer Middle School and Rachel Carson Middle School. The key point here is there is a significant cottage industry of TJ prep classes, which a large portion of the admitted students have been enrolled in for a long time. These programs start in middle school or earlier in elementary school, and are often the most profitable (and therefore the most accessible) in wealthy suburbs. The students who patronize these institutions are wealthy enough to afford prep classes. The prep companies are also primarily located and advertised within white and asian enclaves, which (as a result of lasting segregation in Northern Virginia) means they rarely cater to black, hispanic, or indigenous populations. For context, the prep classes either prep you for the exam (parents pay to keep their kid accountable to a study schedule on how to &quot;beat&quot; the test, which in turn makes the test meaningless in measuring intelligence or measuring work ethic), or they prep you for the Student Information Sheet (in which the test prep company becomes a marketing agency for the fourteen year old's &quot;resume&quot;), which basically just exploits the observed biases in the nondeterminism of the admissions office. Like any budget spent on marketing a product, the marketing doesn't make the product any better, it just makes it more likely to succeed in the marketplace.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Now, hopefully, my original question makes sense. What is an equitable way to allocate scarce resources to undifferentiated consumers? I prefer making the nondeterminism explicit with a lottery, rather than hiding it behind a holistic review. This is the only way to preserve the equality of opportunity for the northern Virginia community. It also preserves the essential quality of TJ: motivated students. The lottery is opt in, which includes a minimum GPA requirement and a form for describing your interests. On top of that, TJ hasn't lost its reputation as a place that will grind you down with a lot of coursework. As a result, the people who apply to TJ will be qualified to attend TJ by virtue of their passion, and among those qualified students, the selection will be left up to chance.</p>
<p>One important thing to note is that it already was random (everyone knows the refrain &quot;admissions are always a crapshoot&quot;). At least now, the program is honest about that, and we can take tangible steps to make sure the bias in the distribution sampling isn't discriminatory. There is an element of <em>feeling</em> like you had some agency in tipping the scales one way or the other. But that feeling was just to make everyone feel better. At the end of the day, scarce resources will always be allocated in a way that you have very little control over. And, come to think of it, making the nondeterminism explicit might address some other major culture problems at TJ surrounding hyper competitiveness. Hyper competitiveness isn't productive, and significantly harms the students' mental health when they start prepping against their peers as early as elementary school. At least now, everybody can focus on their interests, rather than prep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;TJHS without an entrance exam is no longer TJHS&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This represents a very myopic view of what makes TJHSST a special place. Students who attend, I'm confident, agree that the test isn't what makes TJ special, it is the special resources (access to research labs, a senior thesis project, and quality curriculum), great teachers, and a tightly-knit community of motivated students. Those are definitely not predicated on the admissions exam we took.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;over the desperate pleas of the students and parents&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The TJ community is not a monolith (neither is the immigrant community, for that matter). You should consider what the <a href="https://www.tjaag.org/">TJ Alumni Action Group</a> has to say on this issue, to get a better understanding of the variety of stakeholder viewpoints.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;I don’t see how you reach the point of understanding all the facts and still wanting to dismantle TJHS a decent helping of resentment toward the kind of student who flourishes there [...] And if you tell me that such magnet programs need to end even though you yourself once benefitted from them—well, isn’t that more contemptible still?&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's set aside the fact that you assumed that I have a decent helping of resentment towards my peers and myself, and the fact that you called me contemptible (who needs enemy fire, indeed). I'm not convinced you have understood all the facts. In particular, you fail to grapple with the fact that so few black students decided to attend TJ this year that TJ couldn't even report the number due to privacy concerns. This definitely represents bias in the distribution of students who are admitted, but it is also influenced by Black students' decision not to attend even after being admitted. The fact you missed is that TJ has a toxic culture for Black and Hispanic students.</p>
<p>TJ maintains a school newspaper that has highlighted their stories, and I think you should read two in particular. <a href="https://www.tjtoday.org/29057/new-on-tjtoday/my-not-so-black-and-white-look-at-diversity-at-jefferson/">Here</a> is one from a gifted Black TJ student. And <a href="https://www.tjtoday.org/29172/showcase/what-it-means-to-be-a-tj-latina/">here</a> is one from a gifted Latina TJ student. To care about gifted Black and Hispanic students, you have to listen to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;instead of the other kids either tormenting or ignoring you, they might teach you Lisp or the surreal number system&quot;.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you hit the nail on the head here, that really is one of the beauties of TJ. But I think you make the assumption that everyone would experience this TJ from the white male perspective. The whole point of the lottery system is to reduce some of the torment of the TJ experience for minority students. In case you don't read their stories in their entirety, I'd like to highlight this passage from Didi Elsyad's story in particular, which is unfortunately not about her learning Lisp or the surreal number system:</p>
<p><em>&quot;My desperate attempts to fit in reached an all-time low when, the summer after my freshman year, I tried to bleach my skin. I thought I could look less Black; I thought I’d finally fit in. I almost ruined my skin permanently. As I stared at my blotchy face in the mirror, I realized that one year at Jefferson made the real me – from my culture to my own skin – feel foreign and unwanted. My school didn’t accept me; I didn’t accept me. At that moment, I felt completely and utterly alone.&quot;</em></p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Anyways. I wrote this note to shed some light on why I support the lottery system and think TJ needs significant changes to guarantee the promise of a nurturing community to all of its students. In the first part of the note I explained why the existing system of admissions (even with affirmative actions modifications) is a poor method of allocating scarce resources to the community. In the second part of the note, I responded directly to some of your most provocative claims in your blog post. I tried to take your arguments in the best faith possible, and apologize if I mischaracterized anything you said. I would be happy to reflect on any clarifications you provide.</p>
<p>I don't expect us to see eye-to-eye on this issue, but I hope you'll consider the information I've presented here. I'm happy to make this the beginning of a conversation, rather than the end of one, if you so desire.</p>
