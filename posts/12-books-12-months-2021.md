### *Clap When You Land* by Elizabeth Acevedo (January)

<img style="max-width:25%; float:right; margin:3px;" src='../resources/12-books-12-months-2021/clap-when-you-land.jpg' />

I was gifted this book by Estella Xin for our Turing Scholars secret santa! It was a cute young adult fiction book about long lost sisters. I had just read two heavy works of nonfiction in a row, so this was a nice change of pace. 

### *Interview With a Vampire* by Anne Rice (February)

<!-- <img style="max-width:25%; float:right; margin:3px;" src='../resources/12-books-12-months-2020/basilica.jpg' /> -->

Continuing the theme of light nonfiction books, I was craving a book about vampires, so I found this one through the library. I wanted drama, and I really liked the beginning world building set in New Orleans. I found the latter half of the book to be a bit boring, though. 

### *Braiding Sweetgrass* by Robin Wall Kimmerer (March)

The author of this book, Robin Wall Kimmerer, is an indigenous plant ecologist. I loved this work of non fiction, in which she shared her worldview.

<!-- I read this book because it was recommended to me by Susan. Long distance was hard on our relationship, and we were looking for ways to stay connected despite the separation. We decide to form a little two person book club and try to read this book, but we never really followed through on that idea. Eventually, we decided to break up when I visited her in LA during winter break. I had really liked the part of the book I had read, though, so I finished the book. I think the book, poetically, really represented the way that she pushed me to change in ways that I am really happy with, even after the relationship has ended. I am happy with the ways I grew as a result of our relationship, and I am happy with the ways I grew as a result of this book. -->

One theme that resonated with me was the importance of gratitude. Gratitude is central to my own spirituality, so it was interesting to see how it manifests itself in certain indigenous cultures. 

One question Kimmerer prompts in the book is in what ways are humans beneficial to nature. The point she makes is that humans are not separate from the world around us, and if everything else has a place and a role, then humans must as well. So, as humans, we should not view ourselves as strictly harmful, but instead we must ask how we can best play our role in the mutual relationships that make up our environments. 

This book helped me deepen my own relationship with nature. I was preparing for an intense backpacking camping trip in the early, cold northeast spring, and everytime I was nervous about the coldness and harshness I was anticipating at night, I would read a chapter of this book to rekindle my wonder for the natural world. Although the trip morphed into a half-as-long very tame car camping trip, this book helped me finally identify as "outdoorsy" insofar as I want to be outside and revel in all of nature's glory, even the less than glamorous parts. 

Kimmerer pondered whether it is possible to become indigenous to a place. That chapter felt especially relevant to me, as someone who has moved around so much as a child (eight states and counting!). She eventually came down skeptical of the idea, but I think her analysis prompted me to ask myself what it would feel like to set down deeper roots in a place and in a community. I crave a community that I am integrated deeply enough into that the success of the community feels intertwined with my own success.  

The book really made me want to become a gardener, at least a little bit, which was definitely Kimmerer's intention, but I wonder how to square that with my desire to be absolutely surrounded by a flood of people in a city. Cultivating a garden without having land is the first hurdle, which can, to some extent, be handled with community gardens (although when I looked into the one in Boston, the waiting list was two years long for a plot). But it is even harder without staying put in one place long enough to grow over multiple seasons. So, for the time being, I'm putting my gardening aspirations aside until my life is stable enough to sustain further life.  

Her description of muckraking a pond as an extension of her mothering instinct was particularly poignant to me. I also liked her description of how diverse agricultural environments can promote growth in a way that monocultural farming destroys (the three sisters planted together perform better than each being divided up into a third of the plot each). 

Although I understand where she was coming from, and I respect her decision to appeal to a wide audience, I did feel that some of her political perspectives were a little bit watered down. I also felt that some of her connections from observations about the natural realm to economic takeaways felt like they relied on forced metaphors, especially towards the end of the book. I didn't feel that either of these nitpicks detracted from the book as a whole, but were still worth mentioning. 

This book was awesome, and will definitely be on my list of favorites at the end of the year. 

### *They Called Us Enemy* by George Takei, Justin Eisinger, Steven Scott, and Harmony Becker (April)

Read this short graphic novel about George Takei's experience in Japanese internment camps during World War II for a class I took in Princeton's public policy school on policing. Kind of cheating because I read it for class, but I fell really behind on leisure reading because I was reading so much for my classes (the other reading-heavy class being a political philosophy class on problems of risk in law and society). 

### *See No Stranger* by Valarie Kaur (May)

This is another book Estella Xin gifted me as my Turing secret santa and I absolutely loved it. Valarie Kaur is a Sikh lawyer, activist, and filmmaker and she subtitled the book "A memoir and manifesto on revolutionary love". She attended Stanford for undergrad, Harvard Divinity School, and then Yale Law School, which honestly almost sounds like satire. At first I was worried the book would be a bit too flowery/gimmick-y, but it ended up being very profound for me, and I think Kaur made some very compelling points. 

One thing I really appreciated was how Kaur worked within the traditional warrior metaphor (especially as it rings true to her Sikh identity), but also extended it to a further birthing metaphor. She compares doing the work of organizing to the work of childbirth. She points out that a midwife says "breath, push, breath, push" in a cycle, rather than just instructing you to breath in once, and then instructing you to keep pushing the whole time after that.

She introduces the idea of *vismaad* (TODO go back and find how she originally describes it). As a rhetorical device, pretty much everytime later in the book she invokes the word, I immediately felt a tear come to my eye. This book was a real tear jerker, and many of the tears were from positive rather than negative emotions. 

One of the most interesting subplots to me was how she navigated complicated extended family dynamics in a transformative way as the victim of harm.

I really, really loved this book. It will definitely be on my list of favorites at the end of the year. 

<!-- A lot of her story centers on how she came to age as a Sikh in post-911 America. She also describes some of her anti-war organizing and related interactions with the police.   -->

### *A Midsummer Night's Dream* by Shakespeare (June)

This was a short book I had been meaning to read for a while for two reasons. Firstly, I remember this super in depth episode of Suite Life of Zack and Cody from when I was a kid all about how they did a school performance of *A Midsummer Night's Dream* and honestly I had no idea what was going on so I wanted to read the original reference. Secondly, when I was in New York City in the summer of 2017, I had desperately wanted to get tickets to Shakespeare In the Park, and I had entered the ticket lottery every week. That summer they were doing *A Midsummer Night's Dream* and I never got a ticket to go even though I had mentally hyped myself up about it so much. So yeah, I felt I needed to read this eventually. 

It was super short and entertaining to read! Just what I was looking for in terms of lighthearted fiction. Next up for when I'm feeling Shakespeare again is *Hamlet* so I can finally have read the source material for the "to be or not to be" soliloquy that I'm strangely familiar with ever since my friends had to memorize it freshman year of college. 

### *All About Love* by bell hooks (June Bonus Round!)

I'm spending the summer working at a Public Defender's office in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I picked this book up from the local library I pass everyday on my walk to and from my office. I had loved *See No Stranger* and wanted to read more about love as a concept. Bell hooks had also been heavily cited in many of the things I've enjoyed reading, including *See No Stranger*. So when I walked into the library and saw a central display with *All About Love* by bell hooks I was like "okay I know what I'm reading next lol".

Unfortunately, I set my expectations too high, and felt this book didn't necessarily live up to them. 

One problem, for me personally, was that I've read so much stuff that has been so deeply influenced by bell hooks, that going back to read the source material meant most of it was not particularly new to me. If anything, that is more to bell hooks' credit that her work was so influential on current scholarship. 

Another problem I had with the book was how it was framed as very self-help. The rhetoric felt too similar to other books I've read that have rubbed me the wrong way (like Dale Carnegie's *How To Win Friends and Influence People* which I had to read for a class in high school and I absolutely hated). Perhaps this is a function of when the book was written, but I also didn't love how the book took essentialist views of heteronormative gender. Finally, the book leaned a surprising amount on Christian theology, which just didn't resonate very strongly with me.  This is hyperbolic, of course, but it was all very "men do this so we women must all do this because of course the Bible said ..." which felt like painting with a very broad brush and also felt very prescriptive without a ton of substance.

All said, I totally respect the place that this book deserves in the literature, and I think bell hooks has made incredible contributions with her work. I just personally was a little disappointed while reading this book based on my expectations. 

### *West Wind* by Mary Oliver (July)

```
Have I ever said that the day was too hot or too cold 
or the night too long and as black as oil anyway, 
or the morning, washed blue and emptied entirely 
   of the second-rate, less than happiness  
  
as I stepped down from the porch and set out along
the green paths of the world?
```

My first work of poetry! I have two friends (Diana Cao and Olivia Zhang) who are both much more knowledgeable about poetry than I am, but they both inspired me to learn more! First, Olivia reposted a post by an instagram account (@poetryisnotaluxury) of a Mary Oliver poem (*Wild Geese*) that I loved. Then I followed the account, and came across another poem (*Moments*) that I loved, which also happened to be Mary Oliver. Finally, Olivia posted one more poem (*Don't Hesitate*) that I loved, which **also** happened to be Mary Oliver. I took that as a sign that I should do a bit more digging.

I found this book of poems from the library, so that was convenient. After I was about halfway through the book, I asked Diana for advice on how to read poetry because I felt like I was just reading similarly to how I read prose, which felt wrong to me. She gave me great advice (approach the poem as a visual form of art arranged on the page before you dig into the substance!) and said she typically doesn't read poetry books cover to cover. I was enjoying it, though, and felt like I needed to read more poetry before I could form any opinions, so I went ahead and finished reading the poems over the course of June (and finished the book in early July).  

Also, fun fact, Mary Oliver is from Ohio, too!

Favs from this collection: *Am I Not Among the Early Risers*; *Spring*; and *Have You Ever Tried to Enter the Long Black Branches*.

### *A Thousand Mornings* by Mary Oliver (July Bonus Round!)

<img style="max-width:25%; float:right; margin:3px;" src='../resources/12-books-12-months-2021/a-thousand-mornings.jpg' />
```
Have I lived enough?
Have I loved enough?
Have I considered Right Action enough, have I
  come to any conclusion?
Have I experienced happiness with sufficient grattitude?
Have I endured loneliness with grace?
```

I really didn't expect to double up on Mary Oliver poetry collections, but this book found me. When my friends and I from this summer took a weekend trip from Albuquerque to a cabin in Colorado, I asked to borrow any poetry books my friend Elisa Cibils happened to have laying around. I started *A Thousand Mornings* that Saturday morning, and finished it the next day.

Mary Oliver's poems have given me a really good outlet for something I've been thinking about since I read *Braiding Sweetgrass*. I can and should appreciate and nurture my love for the earth in the same way I appreciate and nurture my love for my friends, family, and romantic partners. In college, I used to feel like I should be an outdoorsy person just based on my aesthetic, but it wasn't until pretty recently that I really became an outdoorsy person who just wants nothing more than to go outside and touch grass. I aspire to have the same relationship with the world that Oliver does, and age with the same wisdom and playful spirit she did ("And I am in that delicious and important place, roaring with laughter, full of earth-praise"). 

Favs from this collection: *I Go Down to the Shore*; *I Happened To Be Standing*; *Foolishness? No, It's Not*; *The Gardener*; and *The Man Who Has Many Answers*. 

### *Voyage Along the Horizon* by Javier Mar√≠as (July Bonus Round!)

<img style="max-width:25%; float:right; margin:3px;" src='../resources/12-books-12-months-2021/voyage-along-the-horizon.jpg' />

Fun story: I knew *All About Love* was very overdue, and I went in to my local library on the way home from work completely ready to pay a fine for my error. As I handed the book to a librarian, I asked where I could pay my fine. They looked at me quizically, took the book, and told me I would only have to pay if it was so wildly overdue that it had gone "into collection". They confirmed I didn't actually have any fines to pay, and seemed to almost inwardly laugh at my naivete. Maybe times have changed, because I certainly remember paying fines at the library when I was a kid!

Anyways, while I was at the library, I browsed a bit for a casual work of fiction to get my mind off the heavy realities of the world I was facing at work. This book was on one of the special library displays for cool writings about the Artic to help chill people out during the desert summer. This book, for example, was next to a Nordic cookbook that I leafed through. Sure, the display was a bit of a silly gimmick, but that's the kind of lovable goofiness you can expect from a local library. 

Perhaps this is a spoiler, but the book was a work of fiction about an ocean expedition during the early 1900s that was ostensibly bound for Antartica, but that never even reaches any further south than Tangiers. So perhaps it was not perfectly categorized in the library display, but I respect the vision the librarians were going for. 

I wasn't super impressed by the book overall, so I wouldn't really recommend it. No complaints or anything (it was at least entertaining enough to finish), but nothing spectacular either.
